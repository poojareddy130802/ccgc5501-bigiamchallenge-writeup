## Solution  
The task I tackled involved using Cloudfoxable, a tool for working with AWS instances and their associated permissions. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of how I successfully retrieved the flag:

1. **Enabled Bastion Host in Terraform**  
   First, I enabled the Bastion Host in the `terraform.tfvars` file located in the `cloudfoxable/aws/` directory by setting `bastion_enabled = true`. After that, I ran `terraform apply`. However, I encountered an error stating that the policy in two files was not in proper JSON format, with the message:
   
   ```  
   Planning failed. Terraform encountered an error while generating this plan.
   Error: "policy" contains an invalid JSON: invalid character '\n' in string literal
   ```
   
   To fix this, I hardcoded the `user_ip` variable value in the `terraform.tfvars` file, and the error was resolved.

2. **Installed Cloudfox**  
   I installed Cloudfox by following the instructions from the official Git repository to set up the environment.

3. **Finding Instance ID**  
   Once Cloudfox was up and running, I found the instance ID by running the command:  
   ```
   cloudfox aws -p cloudfoxable instances -v2
   ```
   This helped me locate the relevant EC2 instance.

4. **Accessing the Instance via SSM**  
   From the loot file generated and stored locally, I found the command required to use AWS Session Manager (SSM) to connect to the instance. I then followed the official AWS documentation to install the Session Manager plugin on my local machine.
   
   With the plugin installed, I was able to connect to the instance using the command:  
   ```
   aws ssm -p cloudfoxable start-session --target <target id>
   ```

5. **Listing Permissions**  
   I used the following command to list the permissions associated with the instance:  
   ```
   cloudfox aws -p cloudfoxable permissions
   ```
   This resulted in a long list of permissions, which made it a bit overwhelming. I then filtered the results by specifying the role of the instance using:  
   ```
   cloudfox aws -p cloudfoxable permissions --principal reyna
   ```

6. **S3 Bucket Access**  
   In the filtered permissions, I discovered access to an S3 bucket. To inspect the contents, I ran:  
   ```
   aws s3 ls s3://cloudfoxable-bastion-0xtln
   ```
   Inside the bucket, I found a file named `flag.txt`, which contained the flag value. I displayed its contents using the `cp` command, which finally gave me the flag.
   ```
   aws s3 cp s3://cloudfoxable-bastion-0xtln/flag.txt -
   ```


## Reflection

- **What was your approach?**  
   My approach was methodical: start by addressing the initial Terraform issue, then systematically progress through finding the EC2 instance, using SSM to access it, listing permissions, and eventually finding the flag in the S3 bucket.

- **What was the biggest challenge?**  
   The biggest challenge was sorting through the large list of permissions and not knowing exactly where the flag might be located. I had no prior experience with Cloudfox, so it took a bit of trial and error to figure out which permission was relevant for accessing the S3 bucket.

- **How did you overcome the challenges?**  
   I overcame this by filtering the permissions list using the role of the instance, which narrowed down the results significantly. This gave me a much clearer view of what resources the instance had access to, ultimately leading me to the S3 bucket containing the flag.

- **What led to the breakthrough?**  
   The breakthrough came when I realized the flag was most likely stored in an S3 bucket, given my past experience with similar challenges. Once I had access to the S3 bucket, finding the `flag.txt` file was the key moment.

- **On the blue side, how can the learning be used in future?**  
   This experience reinforced the importance of filtering large data sets, whether it's permissions or logs, to narrow down what's relevant. I can apply this approach in future challenges when dealing with complex permission structures or large outputs, making it easier to locate critical information like flags or access points.

This experience also gave me a deeper understanding of AWS permissions and how tools like Cloudfox can help streamline the process of managing and interacting with AWS resources.
